 * Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "derivative works",  *

 * following with any software or content covered by this license          *
 * ("Covered Software"):                                                   *
 *                                                                         *
 * o Integrates source code from Covered Software.                         *
 *                                                                         *

 * o Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the    *
 * results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which will *
 * execute anything you tell them to).                                     *
 *                                                                         *
 * o Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The *
 * installers produced by InstallShield are an example of this.  Including *
 * DRAKVUF with other software in compressed or archival form does not     *
 * trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source decompression  *
 * or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.  For the    *
 * purposes of this license, an installer is considered to include Covered *
 * Software even if it actually retrieves a copy of Covered Software from  *
 * another source during runtime (such as by downloading it from the       *
 * Internet).                                                              *

 * This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation  *
 * of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret *
 * the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to   *
 * the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of     *
 * these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,      *
 * particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing      *
 * source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.    *
 *                                                                         *
 * Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,    *
 * must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including *
 * obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of    *
 * the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be         *
 * allowed.  All GPL references to "this License", are to be treated as    *
 * including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.        *
 *                                                                         *
 * Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered     *
 * Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL *
 * software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must   *
 * be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open *
 * source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of    *
 * DRAKVUF or grant special permissions to use it in other open source     *
 * software.  Please contact tamas.k.lengyel@gmail.com with any such       *
 * requests.  Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source     *
 * software into Covered Software without special permission from the      *
 * copyright holders.                                                      *

 * If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using     *
 * DRAKVUF in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above,         *
 * alternative license can be requested from the author to integrate       *
 * DRAKVUF into proprietary applications and appliances.  Please email     *

 ***************************************************************************
 * This plugin is part of the master's thesis of Klaus-Günther Schmidt,    *
 * student of FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg (DE) in cooperation with Politecnico   *
 * di Milano (IT) during 2020/2021.                                        *
 * The main goal of this plugin is to efficiently dump executable pages    *
 * which afterwards could be processed by analysis tools to detect         *
 * malware. The goal is reached by installing several traps:               *
 * 1. mmAccessFaultTrap: Whenever a MmAccessFault is called (to commit     *
 *    virtual memory) the regarding virtual address is saved. Additionally *
 *    the second trap is set up:                                           *
 * 2. When MmAccessFault returns to the original code it provides the      *
 *    physical address the virtual address was assigned to. This           *
 *    information is saved as well and used to set up a third trap:        *
 * 3. Whenever instructions are fetched from the physical address (frame)  *
 *    to be executed, this trap dumps the memory of the frame or even the  *
 *    whole vad node.                                                      *
 *    To be aware of further executions of this page but prevent duplicate *
 *    dumps, this execution trap is replaced by a fourth, write trap.      *
 * 4. The write trap is reacting on any writes at the monitored memory and *
 *    replaces itself with an executable trap (3). By continuously         *
 *    swapping trap 3 and 4 memory a dump of the same memory area is only  *
 *    performed, if the memory was modified in the mean time.              *
